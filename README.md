# 🚀 Vault Smart Contract AMM Integration

## 📄 Project Overview
This project implements a **Vault Smart Contract** that allows users to deposit tokens, receive shares representing their stake, and withdraw their assets. The vault owner manages strategies, including **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** like Uniswap/Sushiswap and **Aave** integration for lending/borrowing. The owner is also responsible for rebalancing, token swaps, and strategy adjustments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.
- **Foundry**: Development environment and testing framework.
- **Chainlink**: Oracles for reliable price feeds.
- **Aave Protocol**: For lending and borrowing.
- **Uniswap/Sushiswap**: AMM integration for token swaps.

## 📋 Features & Requirements

### Vault Core Functions
- **Deposit/Withdraw**:
  - Users can deposit tokens into the vault to receive shares.
  - Users can withdraw their tokens based on the current value of their shares.
- **Share Calculation**:
  - Shares represent a user's ownership of the total assets in the vault.

### AMM Integration (Uniswap/Sushiswap)
- The **owner** can swap tokens on AMMs to optimize returns.
- Manage **slippage** and **price impact** during token swaps.

### Aave Integration
- The **owner** can lend or borrow assets on Aave.
- Maintain a healthy **collateral ratio** to leverage strategies.

### Owner-Controlled Actions
- **Rebalancing & Strategy Switching**:
  - Only the vault owner can perform rebalancing, strategy switching, and token swaps.
  - Allows for dynamic adjustments based on market conditions.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shadowsupercoder/vault-aave-Integration.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd vault-aave-Integration

# Install dependencies
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable

```

### 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
forge test
```

## 📄 Usage

### 📥 Deposit Tokens
Users can deposit tokens into the vault and receive shares representing their stake.

```solidity
vault.deposit(amount);
```

### 📤 Withdraw Tokens
Users can withdraw their tokens based on the value of their shares.

```solidity
vault.withdraw(shares);
```

### 🔄 Rebalancing & Strategy Management
The vault owner can manage strategies, rebalance assets, and perform token swaps.

```solidity
vault.rebalance();
vault.swapTokens(tokenA, tokenB);
vault.lendOnAave(amount);
vault.borrowFromAave(amount);
```
